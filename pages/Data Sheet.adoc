# Data Sheet


The **Data Sheet** page provides a list view of your organization, which is helpful when you need to customize how you see your organization's data or edit the data for multiple employees at once.

You can use the Data Sheet as a powerful "source of truth" for all the job and people data within your organization. This page gives you the ability to create a customized view of your data for all of your planning needs. You can control what data displays on the page by customizing the columns you need and sorting by a particular column. You can also use filters to refine which employees and jobs are included in the list.

The fields visible on this page are dependent on your permissions.  For example, even though all employees in your organization can use this page,&#x20;

Select the Data Sheet icon from the left sidebar to view the Data Sheet.

*   The **Data Explorer** view includes all people in your organization and the following fields as columns: Name, Job Title, Manager and Department.

*   The **Open Roles** view displays all open roles and includes a complete set of recruiting and hiring fields as columns.&#x20;

### Filtering the Data Sheet

As most pages in ChartHop, you can filter the data displayed on the Data Sheet page. With filtering, you can choose to see only those people and/or jobs in your organization that you are interested in. For example, you can filter by employeement status and particular changes like departing employees.&#x20;

ChartHop filtering also allows you to create complex filters based on your organization structure as well as most field data. For example, you can filter on all managers that have at least two direct reports. &#x20;

Use Field rules to refine your data to only those employees or jobs that meet certain criteria, like filtering the list for all employees that have birthdays in June.

Note:
Advanced users can learn how to use ChartHop's Carrot query language to build filtering queries. [Learn more.](https://docs.charthop.com/carrot-reference)
